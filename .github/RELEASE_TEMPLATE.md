# Release notes guide

**This file is for reference only. When publishing a release, write the description in GitHub’s Release UI, not in the repo.**

- **Where**: Repo → Releases → Draft a new release → choose tag → paste or write in **Describe this release**
- The actual release content lives only on GitHub Releases; this template is just a format reminder.

---

## Suggested format for the release body

```markdown
## ✨ Highlights
- Key features (bullets)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Technologies used (one per line)

## 📦 How to use this release
- clone / checkout / docker compose commands
- URLs (Registry, Web interface)

**Full Changelog**: .../commits/v1.x · .../releases
```

Use the same structure for v1.0 or later; paste the body into the GitHub Release description when you create the release.
