# 📦 Legacy Web (Pre-React)

This directory stores the **static web build files** used before switching to the React app.

- **html/** 📄 – Static HTML pages (index, registry-list, compose-list, certs, scripts, docs-viewer)
- **js/** 📜 – Page-specific JavaScript (registry-list.js, compose-list.js, etc.)
- **css/** 🎨 – Page-specific stylesheets (common.css, registry-list.css, etc.)

The current service uses the Vite React app build output under `web/app/`.  
ℹ️ These files are kept for reference and recovery only; they are not used for deployment.
